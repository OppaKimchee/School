        /*
        Implement the classes in the following class diagram. 
        The Book class implements the Comparable interface.
        Use implements Comparable<Book> in the class definition. 
        Now, all book objects are instances of the java.lang.Comparable interface.
        Write a test program that creates an array of ten books. 
1.	Use Arrays.sort( Book[]  books ) from the java.util package to sort the array.
        The order of objects in the array is determined using compareTo(â€¦) method. 
2.	Write a method that returns the most expensive book in the array of objects (Books). 
o	The method signature is:   public static Book max ( Book[] books) 
3.	Create another class BookTitleComparator that implements the Comparator interface in which overrides the compare( Book a, Book b) method.
        Use the implements Comparator<Book> in the class definition in order to compare objects of type Book.
        The compare(Book a, Book b) method should compare the titles of the two books. 
4.	Using Arrays.sort( Book[] books, new BookTitleComparator()  ) to sort books by the title.
o	Arrays.sort( books, new BookTitleComparator() );
5.	Create a method to show each element in the array with the following method signature:
o	public static void showBooksArray ( books )
